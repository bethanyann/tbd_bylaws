# Introduction

1. What is a Worker-Owned Tech Cooperative?

   > Worker-owned cooperatives are business enterprises that are owned and governed by their employees. All worker cooperatives have two common characteristics: 1) Member-owners invest in and own the business together, and share the enterprise’s profits, and 2) Decision-making is democratic, with each member having one vote.

   Tech cooperatives could be a solution if you feel alienated by big software corporations and startup culture or you feel alone and in search of solidarity as a freelancer.

### Bylaws and Operating Agreements

Bylaws state how the cooperative will conduct business and must be consistent with both
State statutes and the articles of incorporation. Bylaws are like the owners’ manual of the
cooperative business. Bylaws are not filed with the State, but are considered legally binding
among members.

Bylaws usually have:

- membership requirements and a list of the rights and responsibilities of members;
- grounds and procedures for member expulsion;
- procedures for how to call and conduct membership meetings, methods of voting,
  processes for electing or removing directors and officers, and number, duties, terms
  of office, and compensation;
- time and place of director meetings;
- dates of the fiscal year;
- requirement to conduct business on a cooperative basis;
- how net margins will be distributed;
- process for redemption of members' equity;
- a consent provision that members will include the face value of written notices of
  allocation and per-unit retain certificates as income in the year they are received;
- distribution process for non-patronage income;
- procedures for handling of losses;
- guidelines for how nonmember business will be treated;
- process for dissolution of the cooperative;
- provisions for indemnification of directors; and
- the process for amending the bylaws.
