# Principles

1. We understand that we are all subjects of both privilege and oppression. We strive to work against these oppressions in our everyday life. Thus, we commit to challenge and build our understanding of social justice.
2. We strive to work on projects that do not reinforce any oppression, and optimally, projects that work against oppression.
3. We are in solidarity with the worker-owned cooperative movement. We honor and amplify Black leadership in the US worker cooperative movement. We recognize the need for democratic member control and economic participation. We also recognize that historically, worker-owned cooperatives are vulnerable to unchecked privileges due to the absence of hierarchy.2
4. We hold ourselves accountable to provide pay that allows all members and others who work for us to thrive financially. We offer comprehensive benefits to all members.
5. We are committed to building a safe, joyful, anti-oppressive, physical space in which those who wish to can do most of their Sassafras work.
6. We strive to create a work environment that is empowering of people of color of all genders, women, genderqueer people, and people with disabilities.
7. We believe in computing justice, including but not limited to the ability for people to see and change the code that runs their software. We further endeavor to contribute back to the open source community by sharing useful code and by choosing, and encouraging clients to choose, open source licenses wherever possible.
