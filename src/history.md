# History

TBD Tech Cooperative was formed during the tech layoff slump of 2023-2024 that caused the founding members to reconsider what a successful career in tech has to look like. We found eachother through another Women in Tech slack community and decided to build this co-op together out of a desire to have ownership of our time, align our work with our values, and to have something we can all collaborate and build together that no employer can take away from us.

The founding members solidified the TBD Cooperative during the summer of 2024 and recieved our Articles of Incorporation on July 24th, 2024
