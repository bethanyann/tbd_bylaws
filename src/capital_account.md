# Internal Capital Account System

### General

1. The co-op shall have a system of internal capital accounts as equity accounts to reflect its net worth, to reflect the allocation of net worth among the members, and to determine the redemption value of membership shares and written notices of allocation as hereinafter defined. The internal capital accounts consist of individual capital accounts and a collective account. The sum of the balances of the internal capital accounts is the _net worth_ of the co-op.

### Definitions

1. “Accounting net income” is the book net income for the fiscal year computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
2. “Patronage” is the total number of hours worked for the co-op by members and non-members during the fiscal year.
3. “Member patronage” is the total number of hours worked for the co-op by members during the fiscal year.
4. “Patronage income” is that portion of accounting net income resulting from member patronage and is calculated by multiplying the accounting net income (minus any ancillary income) by the ratio of member patronage to patronage.
5. “Non-member patronage income” is that portion of accounting net income resulting from the patronage of non-members.
6. “Ancillary income” is that portion of accounting net income resulting from transactions that do not facilitate the primary business of the co-op and do not result from member patronage.
7. “Patronage dividend” is the positive amount of patronage income allocated to the members in proportion to their relative member patronage during the fiscal year and may consist of any combination of cash and written notices of allocation.
8. “Written notice of allocation” is the certificate issued to each member specifying the amount, if any, of the patronage dividend allocated to the member and retained by the co-op.

### Individual Capital Accounts

1. The co-op shall maintain for each member an individual capital account that reflects the value of the member’s relative equity in the co-op.
2. The balance in any individual capital account results from and is increased by: (a) the initial membership fee, plus any other paid-in capital from or on behalf of the member in excess of the membership fee, and (b) the amount of any written notices of allocation issued to the member.
3. The balance in any individual capital account is decreased by: (a) any losses allocated to the individual capital accounts, and (b) the redemption, in cash or notes of indebtedness, of a written notice of allocation previously issued to the member and recorded in the member’s individual capital account.

### Collective Account

1. The co-op shall maintain an unallocated collective account (hereinafter, “collective account”) that reflects the portion of net worth not allocated to individual capital accounts.
2. The balance in the collective account results from and is increased by: (a) that portion of retained earnings not allocated to individual capital accounts, and (b) any gifts or grants to the co-op, unless otherwise allocated to individual accounts.
3. The collective account balance is decreased by any losses allocated to the collective account.
4. The co-op shall maintain a collective account balance with reference to a target amount for business purposes defined in the Operating Rules.

### Allocation of Net Income

1. The positive or negative accounting net income of the co-op shall be allocated annually among the internal capital accounts after payment of the cash portion of patronage dividends.
2. Patronage net income, after reductions in accordance with Unallocated Retained Earnings below shall be allocated as patronage dividends to the members on the basis of their relative patronage.
3. Allocations of patronage dividends shall be made within 8 1/2 months after the end of the fiscal year.
4. In any proportions determined by the members and recorded in the Operating Rules, patronage dividends may be paid in cash, in qualified written notices of allocation, or in non-qualified written notices of allocation as defined in Subchapter T of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (hereinafter, “Subchapter T”).
5. The amount of any written notice of allocation issued to a member shall be credited to the member’s individual capital account and the amount thus retained by the co-op may be used for any and all corporate purposes.
6. Written notices of allocation are non-transferable unless otherwise approved by the members.
7. By becoming a member of the co-op, each member shall be deemed to have consented to include in his or her taxable income the amount of any qualified written notices of allocation and to pay tax thereon in accordance with Subchapter T.
8. The co-op shall issue annually to each member an individual capital account statement that discloses their individual account balance and any changes since the previous statement.

### Unallocated Retained Earnings

1. From time to time, the members shall establish and record in the Operating Rules an overall target amount for unallocated retained earnings on the basis of stated business purposes and needs.
2. Annually, the members shall make allocations of retained earnings to the collective account with reference to the target amount and business purposes and needs.
3. Such allocations shall be from: (1) ancillary income and non-member patronage income, and (2) if necessary for business purposes, patronage net income.

### Losses

1. If the co-op incurs a net loss in any fiscal year, such net loss shall be charged against the balances in the internal capital accounts as determined by the members.

### Redemption of Written Notices of Allocation

1. All written notices of allocation credited to a member’s individual capital account shall be redeemed in cash within two (2) years of the date of the notice.

### Redemption of Membership Shares

1. Upon termination of membership in accordance with the Bylaws, the membership share held by the terminated member shall be transferred to the co-op for the consideration defined herein.
2. After year-end adjustments, the member’s individual capital account balance other than positive written notices of allocation shall be paid to the terminated member as consideration for the membership share in cash or other property as determined by the members, within three (3) years of the date of termination.
3. If there is no positive balance in the terminated member’s individual capital account other than written notices of allocation, then the membership share shall be returned to the co-op for no consideration.

### Dissolution Distributions

1. Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of all the assets of the co-op, any assets left after payment of all debts and individual capital account balances shall be distributed to all persons who were members during the immediately preceding ten (10) years, or to their heirs, in proportion to the members’ relative patronage during that period.
2. No distribution need be made to any person who fails to acknowledge the receipt of notice of liquidation in a timely manner. Said notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent by certified mail, at least 30 days before distribution of any residual assets, to the person’s last known business or residence address.

No officer, agent, employee, or other person purporting to act on behalf of the co-op will have any power or authority to bind the co-op in any way, to pledge the co-op’s credit, or to render the co-op liable for any purpose or in any amount, unless that person was acting with authority granted by the members as provided in these Bylaws, or unless an unauthorized act was later ratified by the co-op.
