# Meeting Cadence

**To establish an expected and predictable rhythm for when we will meet, to make scheduling and coordinating across time zones a bit simpler**

1. Check-Ins: Once every week, performed async in our slack channels
2. Monthly Sync: Once a month
3. Yearly Group Meeting: Once a year

### Check-Ins

1. Once weekly, on a Wednesday, each member-owner is expected to respond to the weekly slackbot prompt with a quick blurb about

- What progress did you make last week
- What are you planning to work on next
- Is anything blocking you from getting work done?

### Monthly Sync

1. Once a month, we will do a check-in to determine if we are on track with project and projected efforts on them. This can be done async, or can be a virtual video chat meeting as determined by the member-owners as to which way will be most convienent.
2. It will be scheduled on a day and time that the majority can meet

### Yearly Group Meeting

1. This meeting's purpose is to review the progress of the past year, and to set goals on what our big-picture strategy is going forward
2. To comply with any non-member-owner's involvement, this will also bee used as an Annual General Meeting that all participants in TBD Cooperative are invited to attend

**Expected Format of the Yearly Meeting:**

1. 10 days Before the meeting

- Send the follwing:
  - An agenda to all members, member-owners, shareholders, and any other persons involved in the success of the cooperative
  - Any resolutions or proposals the member-owners will be voting on
    - Voting in a new member, etc.
    - Amending the Bylaws
  - Proxy forms (only needed if someone cannot attend)
  - The annual report (only needed if we have opted in to wanting to do this)
  - Any relevant information to be discussed

2. During the meeting

The format of the meeting is quite formal. There is a Toolkit that can be referred to for structure and key takeaways from the meeting:

- [Annual Meeting Toolkit - Cooperative.com](https://www.cooperative.com/programs-services/communications/toolkits-and-samples/annual-meeting-toolkit/Pages/default.aspx)

- All current member-owners must be in attendance unless a previously requested absence has been approved.
- Minutes must be taken or a transcript recorded of the meeting. [Here's a template](agm-minutes-template.md)

3. After the meeting

- Minutes signed by founding members and/or chair committee if one has been established
- Any new Bylaw or Operations agreements that have been passed must be updated immediately following the meeting into the official cooperative documentation
