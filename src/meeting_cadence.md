# Meeting Cadence

**To establish an expected and predictable rhythm for when we will meet, to make scheduling and coordinating across time zones a bit simpler**

1. Check-Ins: Once every week, performed async in our slack channels
2. Monthly Sync: Once a month
3. Yearly Group Meeting: Once a year

### Check-Ins

1. Once weekly, on a Wednesday, each member-owner is expected to respond to the weekly slackbot prompt with a quick blurb about

- What progress did you make last week
- What are you planning to work on next
- Is anything blocking you from getting work done?

### Monthly Sync

1. Once a month, we will do a check-in to determine if we are on track with project and projected efforts on them. This can be done async, or can be a virtual video chat meeting as determined by the member-owners as to which way will be most convienent.
2. It will be scheduled on a day and time that the majority can meet

### Yearly Group Meeting

1. This meeting's purpose is to review the progress of the past year, and to set goals on what our big-picture strategy is going forward
2. To comply with any non-member-owner's involvement, this will also be used as an Annual General Meeting that all participants in TBD Cooperative are invited to attend
3. Since the fiscal year ends in December, this meeting will be held at the beginning of December, between the American holidays that occupy the end of November and the end of December.
